          <h3>UX/UI Designer</h3>
          <h4>UX/UI Designer. Graphic artist. Event planner. Inspired baker. Dog photographer. Creative writer. Coder.</h4>
          <p class="aboutP">Creativity, logic, and connection have always been central in my life as interwoven ways we interact with the world. Understanding those interactions helps create roadmaps to enhance the human experience in a way beyond aesthetics. I have a wide variety of skills and interests when it comes to design, but the underlying thread is a passion for reimagining things as they could be. </p>

            <h3>User Research</h3>

          </center>
          <br>
          <p>When it comes to users, my objective is to get them talking. Ultimately, if it doesn’t work for the user, it doesn’t work for anyone. A mix of quantitative and qualitative data is my preferred solution whenever possible. Qualitative data gives you invaluable trends, but interviews and focus groups give you context along with that crucial human element.</p>

            <h3>User Empathy</h3>
            <img class="iconic" src="./images/Icon2.png">
          </center>
          <p>Needs and frustrations are the core of the user experience. My belief is that finding ways to reach the crux of that and find a solution that serves all parties is not just a goal but a necessity. You need to understand your users to care, and you need to care to get the job done right.</p>

            <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
            <img class="iconic" src="./images/Icon3.png">
          </center>
          <p>When it comes to interviewing, a user who feels at ease and understands their value will give you the best insights. Cultivating an environment where a user trusts that their feedback means something makes such a difference in how you approach a project, and in turn, the end result.</p>
